# Ad Warning Templates

Here you can find templates for printing stickers. 

The stickers are meant to be used to warn consumers when ads are misleading.

## Useage

We currently only have one template, translated into different languages.

That template is the **Ad Warning Template**.

To find printable versions of the template, go to Ad Warning Template/YourLanguage/. The files are named after their ratio, followed by "_print" for printable files, and "_edit", for editable files.

## Translating

You can contribute with translations of an existing sticker, by adding a subfolder (such as Ad Warning Template/Klingon)

If you are unable to create the translated file yourself, feel free to submit an [Issue](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-an-issue/).

If you submit such an issue, make sure to write the template and language in the title, and a translation of all the text in the body.

## Submitting new templates 

If you contribute a sticker template of your own, you need to select a license and include it (compare with the Ad Warning Template directory).

The Ad Warning Template uses a (license)[https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/2.0/] which allows commercial use, since we want companies to be able to print stickers.

However, if your sticker design makes sense printed on a t-shirt, and you want to stop it from being used that way, I recommend a non-commercial (license)[https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/3.0/].

## Licensing

All templates have their own license, found in the LICENSE.txt

## Disclaimer

I do not take responsibility in any way for the useage of these templates.

If you print stickers using these templates, make sure to only stick them to ads which you have legal rights to mark.


Many ad-owners are unaware of the way their ads promote:
* Poor body image
* Lack of self esteem
* Rampant sexism
* Anxiety
* Depression 
* Over-consumption that ruins our planet

As such these stickers provide a vital service to ad-owners, by enabling them to warn consumers of these issues.
